	A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.

  HTML Paragraphs
  The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

  A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
	-->

	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

	<!-- 
	HTML Display
  You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.

  Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.

  With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.

  The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:
	-->
	<p>
		This paragraph
		contains a lot of lines
		in the source code,
		but the browser
		ignores it.
	</p>
