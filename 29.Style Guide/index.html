	A consistent, clean, and tidy HTML code makes it easier for others to read and understand your code.

	Here are some guidelines and tips for creating good HTML code.

	Always Declare Document Type
	Always declare the document type as the first line in your document.

	The correct document type for HTML is:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	-->

	<!-- 
	Use Lowercase Element Names
	HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names.

	However, we recommend using lowercase element names, because:

	1.Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
	2.Developers normally use lowercase names
	3.Lowercase looks cleaner
	4.Lowercase is easier to write
	-->

	<!-- 
	Close All HTML Elements
  In HTML, you do not have to close all elements (for example the <p> element).

  However, we strongly recommend closing all HTML elements, like this:
	-->
	<section>
		<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
		<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	</section>
	<!-- Bad . Don't use this code-->
	<section>
		<p>This is a paragraph.
		<p>This is a paragraph.
	</section>
	<!-- 
	Use Lowercase Attribute Names
	HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in attribute names.

	However, we recommend using lowercase attribute names, because:

	1.Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
	2.Developers normally use lowercase names
	3.Lowercase looks cleaner
	4.Lowercase is easier to write

	<!-- Bad . Don't use this code-->

	<!-- 
	Always Quote Attribute Values
	HTML allows attribute values without quotes.

	However, we recommend quoting attribute values, because:

	1.Developers normally quote attribute values
	2.Quoted values are easier to read
	3.You MUST use quotes if the value contains spaces
	-->
	<table class="striped"></table>
	<!-- Bad . Don't use this code-->
	<table class=striped></table>
	<!--Very Bad . This will not work, because the value contains spaces-->
	<table class=table striped>
</body>
