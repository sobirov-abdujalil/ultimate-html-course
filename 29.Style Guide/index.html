	A consistent, clean, and tidy HTML code makes it easier for others to read and understand your code.

	Here are some guidelines and tips for creating good HTML code.

	Always Declare Document Type
	Always declare the document type as the first line in your document.

	The correct document type for HTML is:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	-->

	<!-- 
	Use Lowercase Element Names
	HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names.

	However, we recommend using lowercase element names, because:

	1.Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
	2.Developers normally use lowercase names
	3.Lowercase looks cleaner
	4.Lowercase is easier to write
	-->

	<!-- 
	Close All HTML Elements
  In HTML, you do not have to close all elements (for example the <p> element).

  However, we strongly recommend closing all HTML elements, like this:
	-->
	<section>
		<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
		<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	</section>
	<!-- Bad . Don't use this code-->
	<section>
		<p>This is a paragraph.
		<p>This is a paragraph.
	</section>
	<!-- 
	Use Lowercase Attribute Names
	HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in attribute names.

	However, we recommend using lowercase attribute names, because:

	1.Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
	2.Developers normally use lowercase names
	3.Lowercase looks cleaner
	4.Lowercase is easier to write

	<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
	<!-- Bad . Don't use this code-->
	<a HREF="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
	<!-- 
	Always Quote Attribute Values
	HTML allows attribute values without quotes.

	However, we recommend quoting attribute values, because:

	1.Developers normally quote attribute values
	2.Quoted values are easier to read
	3.You MUST use quotes if the value contains spaces
	-->
	<table class="striped"></table>
	<!-- Bad . Don't use this code-->
	<table class=striped></table>
	<!--Very Bad . This will not work, because the value contains spaces-->
	<table class=table striped>

	<!-- 
	Never Skip the <title> Element
	The <title> element is required in HTML.

	The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

	The <title> element:

	defines a title in the browser toolbar
	provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
	displays a title for the page in search-engine results
	So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible:

	<!-- 
	Never skip writing <html>, <head> , <body> tags
