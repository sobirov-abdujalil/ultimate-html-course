	HTML Character Entities
	Some characters are reserved in HTML.

	If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.

	Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.

	Entity names look like this:

	&entity_name;
	Entity numbers look like this:

	&#entity_number;
	--><br>
	<span>&#60 = &lt;</span>

	<!-- 
	Non-breaking Space

	Combining Diacritical Marks
	A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.

	Some diacritical marks, like grave (  ̀) and acute (  ́) are called accents.

	Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page.

	Here are some examples:
	1.̀	a	a&#768;	à	
	2.́	a	a&#769;	á	
	3.̂	a	a&#770;	â	
	4.̃	a	a&#771;	ã	
	5.̀	O	O&#768;	Ò	
  6. ́	O	O&#769;	Ó	
	7.̂	O	O&#770;	Ô	
	8.̃	O	O&#771;	Õ
