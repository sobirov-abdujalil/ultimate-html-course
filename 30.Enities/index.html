	HTML Character Entities
	Some characters are reserved in HTML.

	If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.

	Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.

	Entity names look like this:

	&entity_name;
	Entity numbers look like this:

	&#entity_number;
	--><br>
	<span>&#60 = &lt;</span>
