	What are Semantic Elements?
	A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

	Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

	Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content. 

	Semantic Elements in HTML

	Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?

	The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

	The <section> element defines section in a document.

	Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!

	So, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <section> elements.

	<!-- 
	HTML <header> Element
	The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

	A <header> element typically contains:

	one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
	logo or icon
	authorship information
	Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.
