	What are Semantic Elements?
	A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

	Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

	Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
