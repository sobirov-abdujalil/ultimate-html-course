	The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.

  Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.
	Using The class Attribute
  The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

	In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section:
	-->
	<div class="city">
		<h2>London</h2>
		<p>London is the capital of England.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="city">
		<h2>Paris</h2>
		<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="city">
		<h2>Tokyo</h2>
		<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
	</div>
	<!-- 
	Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.

	Note: The class name is case sensitive!
	-->
	<!-- 
	Multiple Classes
  HTML elements can belong to more than one class.

	To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">. The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.

	In the following example, the first <h2> element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class, and will get the CSS styles from both of the classes: 
	-->
	<h2 class="city main">London</h2>
	<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
	<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
</body>
