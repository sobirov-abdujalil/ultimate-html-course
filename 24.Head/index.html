	The HTML <head> element is a container for the following elements: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.

	The HTML <title> Element
	The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

	The <title> element is required in HTML documents!

	The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

	The <title> element:

	defines a title in the browser toolbar
	provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
	displays a title for the page in search engine-results

	The HTML <link> Element
  The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.

  The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets:

  The HTML <meta> Element
  The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

  The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.

	<!-- 
	Examples
	Define the character set used:

	<meta charset="UTF-8">

	Define keywords for search engines:
	<meta name="keywords" content="wikipedia, wikipedia.org">

	Define a description of your web page:
	<meta name="description" content="The Free Encyclopedia">

	Define the author of a page:
	<meta name="author" content="John Doe">

	Refresh document every 30 seconds:
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

  Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices:
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

	<!-- 
	The HTML <base> Element
	The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page.

	The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both.

	There can only be one single <base> element in a document!
