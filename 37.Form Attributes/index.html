	<!-- 
		This chapter describes the different attributes for the HTML <form> element.

		The Action Attribute
		The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

		Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

		In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data:
	-->
	<form action="/action_page.php">
		<label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
		<input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
		<label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
		<input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit">
	</form>
	<!-- 
		Tip: If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page.

		The Target Attribute
		The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.

		The target attribute can have one of the following values:

		Value	Description
		_blank	The response is displayed in a new window or tab
		_self	The response is displayed in the current window
		_parent	The response is displayed in the parent frame
		_top	The response is displayed in the full body of the window
		framename	The response is displayed in a named iframe
	-->
	<form action="/action_page.php" target="_blank">
		<label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
		<input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
		<label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
		<input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit">
	</form>
	<!-- 
	  The Method Attribute
		The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.

		The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").

		The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. 
	-->
	<form action="/action_page.php" method="get"></form>
	<form action="/action_page.php" method="post"></form>
	<!-- 
	  Notes on GET:

		Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
		NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
		The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
		Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
		GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
		Notes on POST:

		Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
		POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
		Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
		Tip: Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information!
	-->

	<!-- 
	  The Autocomplete Attribute
		The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.

		When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.
	-->
	<form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on"></form>
	<!-- 
		
		The Novalidate Attribute
		The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute.

		When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted.
	-->
	<form action="/action_page.php" novalidate>
</body>
