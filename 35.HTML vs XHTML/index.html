	XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML.

	What is XHTML?
	1.XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
	2.XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML
	3.XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
	4.XHTML is supported by all major browsers
	-->
	<!-- 
	Why XHTML?
	XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").

	XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.
