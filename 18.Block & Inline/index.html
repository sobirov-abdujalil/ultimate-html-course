  <!-- 
	
  Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

  The two most common display values are block and inline.
	-->
	<!-- 
	Block-level Elements
	A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
	A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
	Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
	-->
	<p>Hello World</p>
	<div>Hello World</div>
	<!-- 
	Block elements list:
	1.address
	2.article
	3.aside
	4.blockquote
	5.canvas
	6.dd
	7.div
	8.dl
	9.dt
