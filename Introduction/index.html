What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p> 
-->
<!--
 Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
